# School-Projects
Welcome to the School Projects! This repository serves as a collection of in-school projects created during our class sessions. At present, it houses a variety of IDE-contained demo simulations of real-life programs.
Note: All the programs within this repository are designed to run exclusively within an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and can be observed through a command prompt.
In order to run these programs, take all java files in a chosen program folder and insert into an IDE of some sort in order to run the program and see all of its features.

Playlist System
This is a demo version of a playlist system. While it doesn't have audio playback capabilities, it can effectively manage multiple songs and their associated information within playlists. 
Users have the ability to cycle through these playlists, providing an interactive experience to explore and learn about the songs.

RFID Store System
This demo showcases a potential RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) system for use in a store environment. 
With this system, you can insert, remove, and relocate items on shelves and carts. It also allows you to seamlessly check out items, all while tracking their movements and statuses through RFID technology.

Email System
Similar to popular email services like Gmail, this demo email system offers features such as storing emails and their details in various inboxes. 
Users can view, delete, and move messages within this system. Notably, it includes a search and load functionality, which locates and loads previous sessions of the program, preserving mailbox contents. 
Additionally, the program automatically saves the current mailbox upon quitting, facilitating the seamless use of the search and load feature.

Customer Service Program
Our customer service program is designed to assist users with their problems when provided with the correct text file path. 
It generates a sequence of questions aimed at resolving the issue, following a specific format detailed in the included test.txt file. 
Each answer triggers a subsequent set of questions, mimicking the interactive nature of phone call customer services where users respond using a keypad. 
The program also features a history function, allowing users to review their actions upon request.

Thank you for reading.
